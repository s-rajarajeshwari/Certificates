Why Security?

APT - Advanced Persistent Threats
1.Attacks start at weak places then attack several locations
2.Find their way into central network
3.They takeover Admin rights
4.Look into database and get sensitive information without alerting them
5.Use firewalls,network protection, etc..
6.They can work on avg of 200 days in company without knowing them
7.Create alarm systems

Hardening & Patching

1.Hardening - Kicking out everything that is not used and switching on everything that provides additional security
2.Patching - Most vulnerability reported to manufacturer so they release patch

Secure Administration

1.All the active content application passwords are stored in RAM
2.Disconnect is not equal to log off
3.Principle of least privileges - Never login to lower security zone account

Handling Password

1.Hackers first try all language dictionary words
2.Then try bruteforce attack - all combinations
3.We use NTLM hash not LM(LM divides passwords into block)
4.NTLM used when password atleast is 15 characters
5.Use KeePass to manage password
